# Welcome

Hi!  Welcome to my blog.  Here I'll share my notes/tutorials that I've created for myself over the past few years.  Each post will have a link such as this one: [my post on regression]({{< ref "/ols" >}}).  

You may ask why can't I display the content here instead of linking it to a separate place on my website?  Tha answer is that the content displays much better if it's located elsewhere on the website.
