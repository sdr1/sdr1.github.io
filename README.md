# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Steve.  I'm a data scientist.  This is my new website.[^1]  It can be accessed at https://sdr1.github.io or https://stevenrashin.com [^2]

[^1]: If, for some reason, you were looking for my old website, it doesn't exist anymore.
[^2]: I am aware that I have two links to the same website.  I wanted to show you/you guys (for my NYC friends)/y'all (for my Texan friends) that I bought a domain name and keep paying for it.
