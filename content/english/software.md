Over the years I've developed a variety of tools to help me do research.  I've decided to collect them here.

## Detecting Common Text 

This program is used when you have thousands of different files and want to find the ones that are similar.  It works by setting a distance threshold (e.g., a cosine similarity of > 90) and then finding all the groupings of documents that meet this criteria.  

I used this program to detect mass comments in a Securities and Exchange Commission rule that weren't previously classified as being part of a mass commenting campaign.
